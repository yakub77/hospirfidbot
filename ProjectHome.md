We will be using Player/Stage to do this project.  We will simulate a hospital environment with stage and then work on hardware interfaces on the irobot with Player.  We will need to extend player to have better drivers to communicate with the IR and cliff sensors on the irobot create.  We will also need to work on getting the Hokuyo laser working, and we will probably need to write a driver for an RFID reader for Player.  Lastly, we will need to do sensor fusion at a high level to help the robot navigate.
